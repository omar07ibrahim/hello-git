# Greetings from Git Lab!

Hello! This is Omar Ibrahim working through Lab 12 - Git Basics.

## What I've Learned

Through this lab, I've gained hands-on experience with:

- **Version Control Fundamentals**: Understanding commits, staging, and repository management
- **Branching Strategies**: Creating and managing feature branches for parallel development
- **Merge vs Rebase**: Learning when to use each approach and their trade-offs
- **Collaboration Workflows**: Working with remote repositories and understanding pull request processes

## Key Takeaways

Git is an essential tool for modern software development. The ability to track changes, collaborate with teams, and maintain clean project history makes development more efficient and reliable.

This lab has provided practical experience with real-world Git workflows that I'll use throughout my programming career.
